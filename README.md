## About Laravel Ecommerce

This project aims at creating a starter pack for building ecommerce applications 
with Laravel. This comes from a personal need, first and foremost. I have had to build ecommerce platforms severally, and the process of redoing the same thing with just minimal tweaks triggered me to build this as a scaffold that I can use to quickly build ecommerce apps.

The following features will be priority, then more will be added as time goes.
- *Product Management* - Manage products, including digital assets that are delivered on email.
- *Authentication* - using Laravel Breeze.

- *Roles* - Manage user roles and permissions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this, you can run ```composer require```

Since this app is built on Laravel, you may start by creating your laravel app, then require this inside your app.
