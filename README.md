## About Laravel Ecommerce

This project aims at creating a starter pack for building ecommerce applications 
with Laravel. This comes from a personal need, first and foremost. I have had to build ecommerce platforms severally, and the process of redoing the same thing with just minimal tweaks triggered me to build this as a scaffold that I can use to quickly build ecommerce apps.

After Ecommerce is fully implemented, I will begin adding ERP features to it. Essentially, the goal with this system is to build something similar to OdooERP. 
(I know it will take time)

The following features have been implemented:
- *Product Management* - Manage products, including digital assets that are delivered on email. With this, you can manage an ecommerce platform for selling digital assets (such as music, arts etc) and also physical goods (stock management coming soon).

- *Authentication* - using Laravel Breeze.

- *Cart Management* - manage products in your cart.

- *Product Categories* - manage different categories of products.

- *Orders* - manage and track orders made by customers.

The following features are coming soon:

- *Stock Management* - This will allow for effective management of physical goods. 
- *Purchase Management* - This will allow for purchasing and replenishing products when they run out of stock.

- *Roles* - Manage user roles and permissions.

- *Stores and Locations* - Locations will be inside stores. A store may have mutiple locations in it. These locations may contain physical goods.

## Getting Started

To get started with this, you can run ```composer require```
